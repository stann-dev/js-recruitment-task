# JS Recruitment Task // 2018

## Intro

At the beginning I want to apologise for lack of commits. In regular team-based projects I would commit every feature to keep code revision.



**Considering your important notes**
In order to view this project to the end-customer I would work on styling and overall design. But in recruitment task description there was information that I should focus on JS, instead of styling and divs.

## Whats done

- Display list of news from last 30 days `done by simple async fetch; would add loader here`
- Add pagination: 10 items per page `done by default`
- Add news filtering based on section selection from dropdown. `done, sections are fetched by api call and rendered into select element`
- Add search functionality for filtering news content based on provided phrase `done, throttling on keyup by 500ms; would add loader here`
- Each news list element should have following elements... `done`
- Clicking "Read later" button should add selected news to the "Read later" section on the right. Those elements should be stored somewhere and displayed even after refresh. `done, stored in localStorage, also button is grayed out to keep UX more friendly`
- Each element from "read later" can be removed by clicking "delete" button `done`
- (Bonus) It would be beneficial if you would write some kind of tests, either unit or integration `I did write only two simple tests, due to lack of time, and one test should be split into other tests`
- (Bonus) If you will find time, please briefly describe your approach to solving this task. `I'll do my best`

## Summary

I am not fully happy from my work, but I did not anticipate that the task would be time consuming.
